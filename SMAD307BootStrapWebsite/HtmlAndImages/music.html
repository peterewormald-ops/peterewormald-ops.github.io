                      <h1 class="headpad">Music</h1>
                        <p class="lead, backpad">Ok so for reference I am very anal about music, like If there is one thing I think I am best at as a DM it is music. So as such I have spent a lot of time looking for the best way to do this, so here it is.</p>
						
					  <h2 class="headpad">Website</h2>
						<p class="lead, backpad">As for what website to use, you could be boring and use Spotify or Youtube raw (bleh) but frankly Spotify doesn't have a lot of music when it comes to more niche soundtracks, and you can't add your own. Overall it's limited and also expensive unless your already paying for it. Youtube is slightly better but swapping playlists can be a pain and if your playing online your fresh out of luck. So after looking around for a while I found Watchtogether. Watchtogether is goated through and through. Whether online or not it's almost as good as I could hope for. You can add or make your own playlists using Youtube or other lesser known music sources and share that with players as a link online. They can change the volume to their preference, alter settings, and even add songs if you let them. One of my favorite features is just how you select playlists. With a little prep you can find any playlist and song that you want in like 2 clicks. Best of all it's free with no adds if you get an extension. All that to say I love Watchtogether. <a href="https://w2g.tv/en/account/dashboard/?w2gref=https%3A%2F%2Fduckduckgo.com%2F">Watchtogether</a></p>
                   
                  			
					  <h2 class="headpad">Song Selection</h2>
						<p class="lead, backpad">So a big part of what makes music an issue for people is that they don't have either the time or patience to sit down and make their own play lists. Which who am I to judge (though couldn't be me). Then people use a premade 1 hour long video on Youtube that's royalty free and sounds like dookie. One piece of advice; if you hear a song you like while listening to other media steal it before you forget and keep good organization of how you sort your sounds (how you do this doesn't really matter, as long as you know where you would put things even after forgetting where you did, your good) . It takes two seconds and you'd be surprised with the collection you get after just doing that for a couple of years. But if you really can't be bothered or don't have the time here. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@qwerty-po7qh/playlists">My Youtube Channel.</a>
						Trust I have you covered bro. Check the playlists. My playlists aren't super long but each song has been chosen carefully, most if not all loop fairly well. Load this into Watchtogether and boom you have some unique music to match scenes. To be clear if you want schlop to put on and forget about, then this ain't for you. If you want music that uniquely matches the vibe of a scene this is for you.  </p>
