                        <p class="lead, backpad">So there's a lot of things around dming that while software isn't necessary it can help a lot. So here's my list.</p>
						
				 <h3 class="headpad">Map Making</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li>★ <strong>Dungeon Draft</strong>- By far the Best smaller scale battle map maker, one time cheap purchase, mod-able.</li>
						<li>★ <strong>Wonder draft</strong>- By far the Best world/region map maker, one time cheap purchase, mod-able.</li>
						<li><strong>Inkarnate</strong>- Not the best bang for your buck but it is is pretty good if you spend money on it. If you just want want to try your hand at map making the free trial is pretty good.</li>
						<li>★ <strong>Clip Paint Studio</strong>- My favorite drawing, painting, and animation app. If you really want to get into the weeds of making really great looking maps this is it. Get some map making brush patterns and go to town. That's actually how I made the map on the home page.</li>
					</ul>
					  <h3 class="headpad">Game System Recources</h3>
					<ul>
					  <li> ★ <strong>5etools- </strong>The best DnD website period. All sourcebooks are free, multiple generators, has integration with Foundry/roll 20 Love it. </li>
						<li> <strong>DnD beyond- </strong>has some useful things like encounter builder that does CR math for you. If you really wanna get the most out of it though you need a lot of money.</li>
					</ul>
					  <h3 class="headpad">Notes</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>★ <strong>Google docs</strong>- Good for sharing notes or simple session notes.</li>
							<li>★<strong> Obsidian notes</strong>- Good for simple session notes, and is mod-able so you can kit it out to your liking.</li>
							<li>★ <strong>Kanka</strong>- Great free worldbuilding tool especially if you want to share stuff with players. </li>
							<li>★ <strong>One Note</strong>- Literally my favorite not taking software in general. Not specifically built for DnD but so good it doesn't matter.
							</li>
              			</ul>
					<h3 class="headpad">Tips</h3>
						<ul>
						  <li>Try out other game systems! It seems daunting at first but trust me when you branch out from DnD you learn a lot about how games work in general and you get things you can take back to use in DnD. Also a lot of them are free to get into, have great indie devs, and are just good fun. Some of my favorites are Spire, Mothership, and Alice is Missing.</li>
						  <li>If you want to get good at running games it can be easy to get lost in the sauce of looking up Youtube tips of how to get better or just feel lost. But trust, it sounds cliche, and it is, but it works. JUST KEEP PRACTICING. Keep running/playing in games and after wards go through and think what worked and why. Even just ask your players, overtime you will get better. </li>
							<li> If you do want more specifics on how to get good outside of just practice, I would recommend looking into doing improv and/or writing stuff. One of the best tricks I've found to making a campaign engaging is by having a central theme and at session 0 helping players make their characters based around that theme. I promise it's a lovely thing.</li>
							<li class="megabackpad">Have session 0s. Please. For the unitiated, a session zero is when a dm explains the premise for a campaign and players share their ideas for characters ect. ect. Basically all of the set up work that involves players is done in and around the session zero. But yea, session zeros if done correctly, you don't have to work nearly as much the rest of the campaign. If players have interesting characters that have built in conflict and things they care about in the world and between each other your story writes itself sometimes. Also if players have boundaries or lines they want to discuss this is a good place for that. </li>
